		<h2>Welcome to my Blog</h2>	
		<h3>My first Post - My decision on <u>not</u> having a comment box.</h3>
		<p><i>October 1, 2016 by Karla</i></p>
		
		<p><a href="https://fizzle.co/sparkline/debate-should-you-allow-comments-on-your-blog-find-out-what-two-remarkably-popular-bloggers-think" class="article">"...Should You Allow Comments on Your Blog?"</a></p>
		<p>As I was building this page, I wanted to add a comment secton following my written pieces. I spent quite sometime learning how to create a comment box, which wasn't that difficult. The difficult part about it was learning out to retreive the comments which involves other programs such as PHP and others - out of the scope for the FEWD class. Moreover, while browsing through the internet I ran across the article, which I've attached the link above, debating if bloggers should allow comments on their site. Although, I agree with both sides of the debaters, I think I wanted to move away from having to monitor comments on my blog, not to mention the work I would have to put into on the backend of it.</p>
