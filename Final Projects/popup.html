                       <p>I was drawn to coding after watching the  "Code Girl" documentary cast interview. I was amazed at how a group of young teen girls were motivated about bettering their communities through technology. In November 2015, I decided to learn online and found it very similar to my academic and professional background. The transition would be easier than expected.</p> 
                       <p>The process of coding is similar to architectural design and construction. Creating the layouts and wireframes is almost like drafting drawings, coding in HTML is like building the foundation. Whereas, CSS is like designing the interiors of the built structure while specifying the aesthetics. The awesome thing about coding though is that as a designer, you don't have to wait years to see your final project...I love that.</p>
