<p><img src="RevSally.jpg" alt="Sally Photo"><firstletter>S</firstletter>ally grew up in a traditional WV Baptist church but knew at an early age that there had to be "something more."  She left organized religion and found her spiritual comfort and inspiration in nature. Living most of her life on the Outer Banks of NC, she found inner peace and solace near the ocean.Tragedy struck her family, first in her brother's suicide, father passing soon after....then sister and mother's, death.Through these transitions, Rev. Sally sought real answers to life's heaviest questions.</p> 
<p>In the early 1990's Sally found Arlington Metaphysical Chapel while doing business in the Georgetown area.  She received "messages" through Rev. Reed Brown, a well known medium, ...first from her brother John, then from her father.  Although these messages from her family through Rev. Brown were accurate and evidence of their continuance of life affirmed, there were many questions left unanswered.Sally decided to volunteer at The United Metaphysical Churches headquartered in Roanoke, Va., for several years in the kitchen.  There, she thought, she would "see" who these people really are and how this spirit communication was done.This quest in Roanoke led her to her love of Divine Metaphysics and her attendance at the Seminary at Roanoke. Sally became an ordained minister and certified medium out of that organization.</p>
<p>The question of "how these metaphysical things can happen in a physical world" led Reverend Sally to study Quantum physics where she found that its theories explained the mysteries found in divine metaphysics.Now known for her work in mediumship, Rev.Sally states,  "The joining of Divine Metaphysics and Quantum physics is truly where spirituality and science meet."  This nexus is where Rev. Sally has found answers and a philosophy that makes sense in a 21st century world.</p>
<hr>
<p>​​<firstletter>O</firstletter>ur philosophy, Divine Metaphysics, is not represented equally in any town in America.  Look around you. How many Baptist churches can you count in Northern Virginia? But there is only one Metaphysical Chapel.Reverend Sally Knuckles realized that there was a need for another Metaphysical ministry.The Northern Virginia Metaphysical Fellowship began in 2015, chartered under the United Metaphysical Churches.</p>
<p>It’s a brave new world and an honor to be the second Metaphysical ministry in Northern Virginia.Providing Divine Metaphysical teachings, services and workshops for the community, we believe that Divine Metaphysics is the Spirituality for the 21st century;  its where Science and the Divine meet.</p>
